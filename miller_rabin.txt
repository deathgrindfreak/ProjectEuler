Input: n > 2, an odd integer to be tested for primality;
       k, a parameter that determines the accuracy of the test
Output: composite if n is composite, otherwise probably prime
write n − 1 as 2s·d with d odd by factoring powers of 2 from n − 1
LOOP: repeat k times:
    pick a randomly in the range [2, n − 1]
    x ← ad mod n
    if x = 1 or x = n − 1 then do next LOOP
    for r = 1 .. s − 1
        x ← x2 mod n
        if x = 1 then return composite
        if x = n − 1 then do next LOOP
    return composite
return probably prime
